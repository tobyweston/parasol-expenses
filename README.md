# Parasol Expense Scrapper

Scrap a financial year's worth of expenses and attempt to categorise them.


## Caveats

There are plenty. This is hacky-as-hell as I needed something fast to help get my self assessment done. Please don't hate me.

Specifically:

* Pagination of the expenses page isn't supported. It assumes you'll have less than 50 expenses for a given tax year.
* The tax year is hardcoded. Go find it.
